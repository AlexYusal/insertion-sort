        step 1: we start with an unsorted array of numbers 
        [3, 5, 1, 9, 8, 2, 7, 6, 4]
        step 2: we start with the first element (3) in the array
        step 3: we compare the first element (3) with the element after it (5)
        step 4: if 3 is greater than 5, we swap the elements
        step 5: but if 3 is less than 5, we don't swap the elements
        [3, 5, 1, 9, 8, 2, 7, 6, 4]
        step 6: so we compare the third element (1) and should be moved into the first position (3)
        [1, 3, 5, 9, 8, 2, 7, 6, 4]
        step 7: so we compare the fourth element (9) and should be moved into the second position (5)
        [1, 3, 5, 9, 8, 2, 7, 6, 4]
        step 8: so we compare the fifth element (8) and should be moved into the fourth position (9)
        [1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 7, 6, 4]
        step 9: so we compare the sixth element (2) and should be moved into the second position (3)
        [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 7, 6, 4,]
        step 10: so we compare the eight element (7) and should be moved into the fifth position (8)
        [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 6, 4]
        step 11: so we compare the nineth element (6) and should be moved into the fifth position (7)
        [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4]
        step 12: so we compare the tenth element (4) ans should be moved into the fourth position (5)
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
        Finally the array is sorted
